GE 120: Intro to OOP
Maria Fe Fortes

Machine Exercise 2: 
Write a script that executes a sentinel-controlled loop that asks for the Distance and Azimuth (in decimal degrees) of a line.
If yes, the process must repeat until dictated otherwise. 
Finally, the script must print out a small table showing the line Number, Distance, and Bearing (in DMS, converted from Azimuth in DD) of all of the lines.
